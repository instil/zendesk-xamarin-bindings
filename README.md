Currently, only Chat is supported so the following instructions focus on that. Should another SDK be required, the same pattern should be followed but some instructions here (especially around the Android dependencies) should be updated accordingly.

Let's get goingâ€¦

## Install Dependencies

From the top level folder run the following script:

```bash
$ ./INSTALL-DEPENDENCIES.sh
```

## iOS

### Generate iOS Bindings

The required surface area for the API is quite slim compared to everything that the SDKs offer. To get messaging with chat for example, we only need a handful of classes and methods. Objective Sharpie can help produce API Definitions but it will often make mistakes and will attempt to output everything that the SDK exposes. So ultimately the definitions are handcrafted, but it's useful to begin by pasting content from the Objective Sharpie output.

To run Objective Sharpie on an SDK:


```bash
$ sharpie bind --sdk=iphoneos14.5 --output="-Definitions/ChatSDK" --namespace="ZendeskiOS" --scope="chat_sdk_ios/ChatSDK.framework/Headers" "chat_sdk_ios/ChatSDK.framework/Headers/ChatSDK-Swift.h"
```

The tool does not produce perfect binding definitions, some adjustments will almost always need to be made. Particularly around `[Protocol]` which seems to require a `[BaseType(typeof(NSObject))]` to work in generated code.


Open the ZendeskXamariniOSBindings solution and check that the definitions in the `ApiDefinitions.cs` and `StructsAndEnums.cs` files are correct for your usage. Then build & run. The output will be produced within the projects `/bin` folder

Once bindings are generated, locate the `ZendeskiOS.dll` file and the `ZendeskiOS.resources` folder within `/bin` and copy them to the project where there are to be used. It's very important that the `.resources` folder lives in the same location as the `.dll` package.

### Use iOS Bindings

Once the bindings have been produced, add the `.dll` as a native reference to the iOS project. Presenting a chat view controller will then look something like this:

```csharp

using ZendeskiOS;

void ShowChat() {
    var configuration = new ZDKMessagingConfiguration();
    var chatEngine = ZDKChatEngine.EngineAndReturnError(out var engineError);
    if (engineError != null) {
        Console.WriteLine($"Zendesk engine error: {engineError.LocalizedDescription}");
        return;
    }

    var viewController = ZDKMessaging.Instance.BuildUIWithEngines(new ZDKEngine[] { chatEngine }, new ZDKConfiguration[] { configuration }, out var buildError);
    if (buildError != null || viewController == null) {
        Console.WriteLine($"Zendesk engine error: {buildError?.LocalizedDescription}");
        return;
    }

    PresentViewController(viewController, true, null);
}
```

### Adding support for another Zendesk iOS SDK

iOS can avail of a 'fat' `.dll` containing all the required frameworks so adding something new is quite simple.

1. Add a new submodule dependency for the xcframework that you want to add (e.g. `git@github.com:zendesk/answer_bot_sdk_ios.git`)
2. Open the ZendeskXamariniOSBindings solution and the `.xcframework` as a Native Reference
3. Add any required public APIs to the bindings through an entry in `ApiDefinitions.cs` (and `StructsAndEnums.cs` if required)
    (You can use Objective Sharpie as described above and/or [use the official reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/macios/binding/binding-types-reference)).
4. Build and run as usual

## Android

### Generate Android Bindings



### Use Android Bindings

Once the bindings have been produced, add all the following `.dll` files as native references to the Android project:

- ZendeskChatAndroid
- ZendeskChatProvidersAndroid
- ZendeskCommonUiAndroid
- ZendeskMessagingAndroid
- ZendeskMessagingApiAndroid
- ZendeskSdkConfigurationsAndroid

Now add the required Nuget dependencies:

- Google.Gson
- Softeq.ZendeskBelvedere
- Square.OkHttp3
- Square.OkHttp3.LoggingInterceptor
- Square.Picasso
- Square.Retrofit2
- Square.Retrofit2.ConverterGson
- Xamarin.Google.Dagger
- Xamarin.JavaX.Inject

 Presenting a chat will then look something like this:

```csharp

using Zendesk.Chat;
using Zendesk.Messaging;

void ShowChat() {
    MessagingActivity.Builder()
        .WithEngines(ChatEngine.Engine())
        .Show(this);
}

 ```
